Cropspinner Druid	G	common	Creature – Elf Druid 	139	G	G	When Cropspinner Druid enters the battlefield, you may cast a copy of a card named Crop Rotation. (You still pay its costs. Timing rules do not apply. It’s an instant that costs G. It has “As an additional cost to cast this spell, sacrifice a land.” and “Search your library for a land card, put that card onto the battlefield, then shuffle.”)	1/1		normal	EH1		Garth
